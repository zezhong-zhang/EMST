# Electron Microscopy Simulation Tutorial (EMST)

This is a repository that holds a series of tutorials for theoritical and practical aspect of electron microscopy simulations, aiming to support young researchers in electron microscopy. 
## Software 

MULTEM: https://github.com/Ivanlh20/MULTEM

StatSTEM: https://github.com/quantitativeTEM/StatSTEM

## Development Plan

1. - [x] Basic electron scattering and introduction to MULTEM
(Oxford, 5 Augest 2020)
    - Electron wave
    - Electron scattering using Schrondinger equation
    - Multislice representation
    - Sampling
    - Hand-on MULTEM

2. Quantitative scanning transmission electron microscopy
    - Experiment
        - Characetrise the convergence angle and collection angle 
        - Characterise your detector response
    - Quntification 
        - Peak refinement 
        - Scattering cross-section 
            - Voronoi cell intergration
            - Gaussian integration
        - Atom counting
            - Statistical method
            - Simulation-based scattering cross-section library 
        - Strain mapping
    - Hand-on StatSTEM

3. Kinematic and dynamic electron scattering

4. Elastic and inelastic electron scattering
