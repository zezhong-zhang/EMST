# Electron Microscopy Simulation Tutorial (EMST)

This is a repository that holds a series of tutorials for theoretical and practical aspects of electron microscopy simulation, aiming to support young researchers in electron microscopy. 
## Software 

MULTEM: https://github.com/Ivanlh20/MULTEM

StatSTEM: https://github.com/quantitativeTEM/StatSTEM

## Development Plan

(Oxford, 5 August 2020)
    - Electron wave
    - Electron scattering using Schrodinger equation
    - Multislice representation
    - Sampling
    - Hand-on MULTEM

2. Quantitative scanning transmission electron microscopy
    - Experiment
    - Quantification 
    - Hand-on StatSTEM

3. Kinematic and dynamic electron scattering

4. Elastic and inelastic electron scattering
